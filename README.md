# Car Sales Cluster Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of a car sales dataset with the aim of identifying distinct customer segments based on their purchasing patterns and preferences. The analysis utilizes various clustering techniques, including K-means, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN, to segment the customers. Insights derived from these segments are used to inform targeted marketing strategies, inventory management, and sales strategies.

### Objectives

- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- To preprocess and prepare data for clustering.
- To apply and compare multiple clustering techniques to identify the most suitable model.
- To derive business insights from the clusters for targeted marketing, sales optimization, and inventory management.
